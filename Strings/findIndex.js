// Problem Statement:
// Given a string and a character, find the index of the first occurrence of the character in the string.

// Example:
// Input: string = "Hello", character = "l"
// Output: 2

// Solution Approach:
// Use the built-in indexOf method of the string object.
// It returns the index of the first occurrence of the character in the string.
// If the character is not found, it returns -1.
// So, we can directly return the result of the indexOf method.
